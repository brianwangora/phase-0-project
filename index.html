    <h1>Welcome to Brian's Website</h1>
    <p>My name is Brian Wangora. An aspiring software developer. One of my passiosn is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One">Formula 1</a> and cars.
        I actually want to be a part owner of an F1 team and own several car dealerships.
        I am a <a href="https://twitter.com/MercedesAMGF1?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Mercedes AMG F1 fan</a> and also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari">Scuderia Ferrari fan</a>. 
        My favorite driver is Lewis Hamilton who is arguably the most sucessful driver in the sport.

        Enough about Formula 1.
        I could talk about it for hours.

        Something else I do in my free time is listen to music.
        I have hours and hours of music on my phone.
        However my music choice could be described as narrow.
        I majorly listen to rap and trap music.
        <em>I've not found anyone who has been able to distinguish between the two.</em>
        Anyway, my favorite artists at the moment are Future, Drake, Yeat, Baby Keem, Dave among so many others.
        I'm also a fan of Kenyan music obviously.
